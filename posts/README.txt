The /posts directory is where all of your blog articles belong.

You should have one file named 'home.md' which will be your home page.

All other articles should have a name in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD-article-title.md',
e.g.: '2016-08-28-my-first-article.md'. Files names should be all lower-case.

Each file should be in in markdown format.
