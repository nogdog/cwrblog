# /static/img directory

You can use this for any images you want to include in your posts.

Out of the box, cwrBlog expects a `banner.jpg` file here to use as the page header background.
I used a 2,048px Ã— 532px jpeg which seemed to work pretty well.

You can also put a `favicon.ico` file here, which will then be used as the blog's favicon.
