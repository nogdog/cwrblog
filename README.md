# Charles W. Reace's Simple (I Hope) Blog Framework

The intent here is something where I can just upload markdown files for 
each article, and this will organize them by date and parse the markdown
into HTML.

## Blog Posts

Posts are stored as markdown files in the /posts directory. You need
a home page file called `home.md` there. Any other posts should start
with a date, be all lower-case, and using underscores where you would
logically have a space, e.g. `2016-08-38_my_new_post.md`.

## Images

The /static/img directory should contain a image file named `banner.jpg`
to be used as the background image in the page's banner. You can also 
put a `favicon.ico` file there to be used as the blog's favicon.
