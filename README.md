# Charles W. Reace's Simple (I Hope) Blog Framework

The intent here is something where I can just upload markdown files for 
each article, and this will organize them by date and parse the markdown
into HTML. As a result, there is no admin interface, as the only "admin"
you need to do is use (S)FTP or whatever other method you prefer to
upload your post files.

## Installation

Download or pull this repo. ~~For now, it will only work from your
web root directory. (I have an open issue to change that.)~~ _(fixed!)_ Edit the
`/.config.json` file with desired values for your site.
 
## Blog Posts

Posts are stored as markdown files in the /posts directory. You need
a home page file called `home.md` there. Any other posts should start
with a date, be all lower-case, and using underscores where you would
logically have a space, e.g. `2016-08-38_my_new_post.md`. (Note that the
date portion controls the sorting, so use a "Y2K-compliant" style date
in YYYY-MM-DD format.) The [Parsedown package](http://parsedown.org) 
is used to convert the file to HTML. Additionally, I added code to 
convert " -- " (space, double-hypen, space) to HTML entities for 
thin-space, em-dash, thin-space. The CSS (in `/static/css/style.css`)
makes any image tags within the post float left.

If you use the `/static/img/` directory for images in your posts, use
a relative URL (no leading slash), such as `static/img/your_image.jpg`.

## Images

The /static/img directory should contain an image file named `banner.jpg`
to be used as the background image in the page's banner. (I used a
2,048px Ã— 532px jpeg which seemed to work pretty well). You can also 
put a `favicon.ico` file there to be used as the blog's favicon.
You can use this directory to upload images you want to use in your
posts, if desired.

## Views

cwrBlog makes use of [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
for multiple screen size support. There are a few items in `/config.json` that are used for
values in the head and foot views.

* `banner_title` is the site "name" displayed in the banner at the top of every page
* `title_part_one` is used for the title element within the head section
* `copyright_name` is who you want to list as owning the copyright to the blog content
* `copyright_year` is the earliest year you want listed in the copyright statement
 
### Right Column content

Edit the `/views/right_column.php` file for whatever you'd like to appear in that
column (google search, links to other sites, whatever you like).

## Tests

I added a few PHPUnit tests, more as a way to sanity-check things when I make any
changes. To run them, you'll need to [install PHPUnit.phar](https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html),
then run it from the base project directory:

```
> phpunit tests
```

# To-Do

Trying to decide if I want to add reader comment capability, and if so, how.
